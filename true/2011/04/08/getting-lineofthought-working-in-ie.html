        <h2>Getting Line of Thought Working in IE</h2>
        <div class="article">
          <p>No one likes getting a layout working in Internet Explorer. Luckily there has been a major movement in the web world to not support older versions of IE as usage of those browsers weens. That&#8217;s the aim we&#8217;re taking with Line of Thought as well, and plan to only test the site in the current version and previous version of major browsers. Now that IE 9 is out, that means getting this blog and <a href="http://lineofthought.com">Line of Thought</a> working in only IE 8 and 9. One morning this week I switched over to my girlfriends old windows computer to see the horror.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 and Internet Explorer 8</h3>
<p>The first browser tried was IE 8. Since Line of Thought uses a number of <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 tags including &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, it was pretty obvious the site was going to fail spectacularly, and sure enough it did.</p>
<p>Luckily there&#8217;s a great workaround for this in the form of a shim script. You can read more about this <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">HTML5 enabling script</a> or give it a try. Just make sure to include this in the &lt;head&gt; of your document.</p>
<p>Liquid error: No such file or directory &#8211; pygmentize -l javascript -f html -O encoding=utf-8</p>
<p>So this script won&#8217;t even be included if you&#8217;re running IE 9 or later, but for IE 8 it&#8217;ll help. No css declarations had to change for this, it just worked.</p>
<p>One additional tag I somehow put in was a &lt;sidebar&gt; tag. Apparently I thought this was another new <span class="caps">HTML</span> 5 tag, but it&#8217;s not in the specification. Firefox and Chrome didn&#8217;t complain about this, so it worked fine and was styleable, but the Javascript code wouldn&#8217;t work with it. After going threw and changing these to &lt;section class=&#8220;sidebar&#8221;&gt; tags and changing a few styles everything was working fine.</p>
<p>Surprisingly that was the entirety of getting the site to work in IE8. No individual styles were added, no special cases or hacks required. Part of that is due to the fact that the layout is sparse, and doesn&#8217;t take advantage of many new effects. Those that it does use, such as gradients in buttons, degrade down to single color buttons which work fine in IE8. Luckily things don&#8217;t need to look <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">identical</a>. Total time to get the site working in IE8: less than 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>Internet Explorer 9</h3>
<p>IE 9 brings about support for most new <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags, including all the ones mentioned above.</p>
